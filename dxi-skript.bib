	abstract = {Meaning" may be assigned to a string in a context-free language by defining "attributes" of the symbols in a derivation tree for that string. The attributes can be defined by functions associated with each production in the grammar. This paper examines the implications of this process when some of the attributes are "synthesized", i.e., defined solely in terms of attributes of the descendants of the corresponding nonterminal symbol, while other attributes are "inherited", i.e., defined in terms of attributes of the ancestors of the nonterminal symbol. An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.},

	doi = {10.2307/2266170},
	abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to give a formulation of the simple theory of types which incorporates certain features of the calculus of λ-conversion. A complete incorporation of the calculus of λ-conversion into the theory of types is impossible if we require that λ
              x
              and juxtaposition shall retain their respective meanings as an abstraction operator and as denoting the application of function to argument. But the present partial incorporation has certain advantages from the point of view of type theory and is offered as being of interest on this basis (whatever may be thought of the finally satisfactory character of the theory of types as a foundation for logic and mathematics).
            
            For features of the formulation which are not immediately connected with the incorporation of λ-conversion, we are heavily indebted to Whitehead and Russell, Hilbert and Ackermann, Hilbert and Bernays, and to forerunners of these, as the reader familiar with the works in question will recognize.
            
              The class of
              type symbols
              is described by the rules that ı and
              o
              are each type symbols and that if
              α
              and
              β
              are type symbols then (
              αβ
              ) is a type symbol: it is the least class of symbols which contains the symbols ı and
              o
              and is closed under the operation of forming the symbol (
              αβ

              α
              and
